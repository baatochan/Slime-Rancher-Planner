# Contributing to Slime Rancher Planner
First of all I'd like to thank you for taking your time for making this project better for everyone :blush:

## Questions about this app
If you just want to ask me a question it will be easier for both of us if you hit me up on some messaging apps like Telegram ([@baatochan](https://t.me/baatochan)) or WhatsApp (@baatochan). You can just simply send me an [email](mailto:bartoszka1996@gmail.com) as well.

## Issues or feature requests
If you experience any issue or you have a feature request [let's see if no one before experienced it or thought about that](https://github.com/baatochan/SlimeRancherPlanner/issues) and if not, open a new issue.

In case of issue please follow an issue template. For feature requests just delete the template and write whatever you want.

## Contributing with a real code
If you want to add some features done by yourself I'd start with hitting me up on Telegram on something like that (new issue is ok as well). I may be already doing that or I may not be interested in this particular feature at all.

If that's something small or we've already discussed that feature follow these steps.

1. First of all I really apologize you for the quality of my code.
1. Then you need to create your own fork of the repo.
1. Do all your work in your repo in new branch on top of `develop` branch (it would be awesome if the name of your branch would represent a feature that you're working on).
1. Commit your work frequently (my rule that I try to keep is commit after every new/edited function) and write meaningful commit comments (others need to know what the commit changes just by looking at the commit title and description - so please no commits like 'Updated main.js').
1. It would be awesome if you would follow code commenting rules (comments for functions and so on).
1. When you have some questions don't hesitate to contact me (telegram, mail, issue, etc...).
1. If you think that your code is done open a pull requests. I will then test your code and apply it or give some comments what to change.
1. Thanks again for taking your time to contribute.

Happy ranching everyone :heart:
